To make this site work properly, we sometimes place small data files called cookies on your device. Most big websites do this too.


## What are cookies?

A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site. It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another.

## How do we use cookies?

We use Google Analytics to count page visits. We anonymize your IP before track the visit. 

We also use some sharing buttons from Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. 

We use Disq.us for comments and they may be using cookies to track user behaviour. 

We save in a cookie that you've seen the cookie informative, thus not presenting it again at your next visit. 

Some videos embedded in our pages use a cookie to anonymously gather statistics on how you got there and what videos you visited.

Enabling these cookies is not strictly necessary for the website to work but it will provide you with a better browsing experience. You can delete or block these cookies, but if you do that some features of this site may not work as intended.

The cookie-related information is not used to identify you personally and the pattern data is fully under our control. These cookies are not used for any purpose other than those described here.

## How to control cookies

You can control and/or delete cookies as you wish – for details, see [aboutcookies.org](http://aboutcookies.org). You can delete all cookies that are already on your computer and you can set most browsers to prevent them from being placed. If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some services and functionalities may not work.
