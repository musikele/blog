I hope that you have done some kind of exploration with Javascript, NodeJS and asynchronous constructs right now.

To recap: when you wait for an asnyc operation to handle the result, for example in NodeJS when we read a file, we do this:Â 

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
fs.readFile('filename.txt', (err, data) => {
   if (err) throw err; 
   //now you can use the data object 
   ...
});
```

This is the standard, classic way of handling asynchronicity in NodeJS and Javascript. 

In the last few years a new approach has come to rise, first from outside libraries, then as part of ES6 language. This approach is called **Promise**.

## I promise that I will give you the result
