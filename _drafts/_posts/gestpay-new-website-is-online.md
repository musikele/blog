I'm really exited to write about one of my la test works: **the redesign of Gestpay's website.**

## What is Gestpay 

Gestpay is the most famous Italian payment processor, own ed by Gruppo Banca Sella. It allows websites to accept payments on your ecommerce and your online activities. The main features are:

* Accept credit cards from all over the world

* Integrates with 80+ alternative payment systems, like PayPal, Apple Pay, Alipay, Qiwi, Sofort, Klarna... And many more! 

* Allows to customize the payment form as you want 

* It has multiple layers of Security 

* It is perfect for small, medium and giant businesses

* Their business is 20 years old! 

In the last year i have been involved in many of their works; one of my first jobs was to design a documentation website, with the goal to be as clear as possible. We did it! 

So, what's new about website design in 2017? 

## Working with designers is great
