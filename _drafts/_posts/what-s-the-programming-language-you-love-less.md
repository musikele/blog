Typescript could be an option, but I'm still investigating.

However, frameworks in Java are over-complicated. Just to write Pojos that map to Json, or XML, it's a huge mess that intimidates newcomers. And you must use third party libraries.

For simple things, you might find yourself writing twice the rows of code. 

## C 

I have never studied C seriously, mainly because I didn't need it at work.

First of all, I feel uncomfortable if what I write is not cross platform. With c this happens all the time.

Of course you gain a lot of power by accessing simple memory locations, but given the actual memory available to the random pc, you really don't need this overmanagement.

There is no single serious library that is cross platform.
