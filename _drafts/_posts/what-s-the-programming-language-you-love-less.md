Usually I hear people complaining about Javascript. I can't, because JS is one of my natural languages together with Java. However, let's try to tell, for every programming language, what I dislike the most. 

## Javascript

What I dislike about Javascript is that it's very difficult to write something bigger than 100 files; you simply can't be sure of what you've written without using unit tests. This is a critique that is common to all interpreted languages. 

Typescript could be an option, but I'm still investigating. 

## Java

Java is compiled, and this gives us a great comfort when applying refactorings. 

However, frameworks in Java are over-complicated. Just to write Pojos that map to Json, or XML, it's a huge mess that intimidates newcomers. And you must use third party libraries.

For simple things, you might find yourself writing twice the rows of code.
