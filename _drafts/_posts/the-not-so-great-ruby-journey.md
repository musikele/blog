For work, I have to modify (and even maintain) a Ruby library.

The problem is, I can program in many languages, but I have never programmed in Ruby.

Ruby is not very famous in Italy, there aren't many developers fluent in this language. (This means that finding a fluent ruby developer is a costly process).

So my company had two options: start searching for ruby shops, or ruby developers, comparing prices and quality of their products etc etc. This process could be very long, considering that then you have to explain to the developer what is the business problem we need to solve, etc.

The second option was to give a programmer (me!) the time to learn ruby and rails. I am doing this by following courses on various platforms, reading books, forums, etc. I have estimated that this process might last 1 week... That's not that much for having the job done. And of course, once they have trained a resource, this resource can be available for maintaining the code in the future.

See? cheaper and sustainable :)

However, Ruby for an inexperienced developer is a big headache. Let's see why.

## No past compatibility
