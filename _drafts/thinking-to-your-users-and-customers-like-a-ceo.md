Today I'll talk about Michele-on-the-job.

Some time ago I jumped on a brand new job. It's a "service oriented" job, where we had different customers and we offered a product as a service.

One of the first tasks I got was  to check what was going on with a customer, he claimed there was a misbehaviour of our product.

Now, replicating this kind of problems was really difficult, because at the time the product was not very mature, so the product itself could be blamed; also, many customers were using the product in very unconventional ways and this caused more trouble; finally, the product itself was very susceptible about network conditions, users, browsers, locations, etc. A real mess.

tst!
