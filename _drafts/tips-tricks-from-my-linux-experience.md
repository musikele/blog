  workstation. Here's the best way to use enjoy Linux to become a better developer!

---
While at university I - like many other students - were encouraged to install linux on our laptops, to learn the fundamentals of programming and the internals of operating systems. 

I guess it was 2006-2007 and I installed Ubuntu in dual boot on my machine, but since I'm not an easy guy I decided to use Ubuntu as my first operating system, leaving Windows as a backup. 

At the time drivers support was a mess: there was no support, for example, for a usb DSL modem and a printer I owned. I remember buying an external wifi adapter and that was not working too. I had to consume a lot of time on forums, even translating from french, to make my laptop working. 

However, I was happy with what I had, also because I do not play videogames and I really do not need windows for any special reason (no adobe, no MS Office, etc.). Also, 100% of my job could be done from linux standard tools, and this was something I really loved. 

Let's fast-forward a couple of years, I bought a Mac with my first salary - a Mac that lasted 5 years!) and a Windows PC that is now in it's fourth year. I used it with WSL for some time, then I had to switch back to linux as my daily operating system. 

In this article I'll share some neat tricks I found useful, together with some stories about my experience. If you want to reach the buddha developer status, there are some steps to make!

## Get comfy with the command line 

If you're a Windows user, you can avoid command line for the rest of your life, even as a developer. But if you work in a Unix environment, the terminal becomes one of your best tools to do your job. So, knowing bash is really important - you can automate almost any aspect of your daily routine. The problem is that bash has the most obscure syntax ever, and honestly I can't even remember how to check for a file existence. what a mess! 

However, Bash is still super popular, and if you administer or work on a remote server, chances are your only tool is bash. Here are some resources:
