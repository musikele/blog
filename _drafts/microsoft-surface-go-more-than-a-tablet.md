title: 'Microsoft Surface GO: more than a tablet'

description: I sold my old 15" laptop and I bought the Microsoft Surface Go tablet.
  The conclusions are... unexpected

---
My company has given me a mac, and my old computer ([a Dell XPS, 15", 16 GB of RAM](https://michelenasti.com/2017/10/03/recensione-dell-xps-15-2017.html)) was siitting at home, unused. So I decided to sell it and to buy a convertible - a tablet with a keyboard.

So i wrote down the list of thingneeded and, based on that, the best choice was the **Microsoft Surface Go**. Why have I preferred this to ipads or android tablets? 

### I'm a developer

So my first constraint is that I need to run some tools that are speciific to my work, like Visual Studio Code (an IDE to develop programs) and much more (NodeJS, Python, ...) The idea of locking in a platform that didn't allow me to do that was appalling. 

### I'm a blogger

Not a professional blogger, of course, but I love writing on this blog and I want to do it also from home. Surprisingly, at home I rarely turn on the pc to write something, it looks an overkill. So yes, I needed something with a good keyboard. 

### I'm a traveller 

When I'm on vacation I don't want to carry over a big computer, but just something to organize my trip and to be connected to the word. 

## Microsoft Surface Go

So why the Microsoft Surface Go? This tablet is mainly conceived for students but it's performing incredibly as a day-to-day pc. I'll try to outline two lists, what I like and what I don't like, so you can get an idea of the two.

### What I like 

* The keyboard. Seriously, it's super. 
* The fact that I can fix the keyboard's layout according to my preferences. In fact, I configured my italian keyboard to write characters ``` and `~`. Try to do that on Andoid or Apple... 
* The fact that I can install Visual Studio Code, NodeJS, and even Bash On Linux.
