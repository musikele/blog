  to "appreciate" them. Here's why

Do you love meetings? Do you enjoy taking a break from your work and ~talk~ _listen_ with managers, stakeholders, customers, peers? I suppose you not. If you're like me, 99% of your work life meetings have been a total waste of time. 

For example, I remember one day I had 8 hours of meetings, well actually they were 4 different meetings of 2 hours, but with the same people and with the same manager. 

I expecially remember a boss sentence, "we will discuss later about this, and we will, because this really matters to me", usually meaning that we should never ever take the argument back in a discussion. 

I also remember another meeting, on friday evening, were we decided to use framework "X" to do something, so I start studying it in the weekend, only to find on monday that the company has decided to use Y. 

So, that's why we all hate meetings. I'm sure you had meetings like these, or probably worse. 

But I'm here to say that I've also experienced another way of working: no meetings at all. 

Sometimes I've been _abandoned_ for days, or weeks, just with a task to do. I work remotely, and when you start working remotely this is the first sentiment you feel. It's like, _where's my boss?_. 

One day I read a book about human centered work (in italian): **meetings are a troian horse to introduce changes**. So, before calling your next meeting, ask yourself if all the attendees are actually getting a benefit from it. (With this simple rule, 50% of my meetings could have been discarded). 

I also think that some meetings are strictly necessary. I strongly believe that the main role of a boss is to give the strategic _direction_ to the team, and there's no mail that can substitute the facial expression or the tone of voice.

So, let's go back to the title of this post. Yes, I work remotely, and yes, I do two meetings per day. Two video-meetings actually. The first one at 9:30 is to kick off the day, the second at 15:30 as a status update. 

They don't last long, usually in 5 minutes they are done, but it's a ritual that helps me accomplish my tasks. 

The best part of this is that we use a software were we can all watch our faces during the meeting, and the default is that we all see each other. This actually gives a lot of humanity to remote working: as programmers, we are used to solve problems via chat, by typing, but that's the slowest way to solve problems. 

Even one-on-one video calls are an option and we switch to that whenever it's the clearest (& fastest) way to solve a problem. 

So ... should your company do video meetings every day? If your team is small enough, and you all work in the same time zone, why not. As a programmer, I like to see that managers - and peers - are interested in what I'm doing.
