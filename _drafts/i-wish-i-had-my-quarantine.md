description: Trying to cover a hole in my learning on quarantine

---
Hello devs, I wrote this article during COVID-19 quarantine,hopefully you'll read this post many years later and we'll think of this period as a not-so-painful memory.

Italy was one of the first countries to start a hard quarantine, and expecially in my region we had closed restaurants, bar, gyms. So, in theory, we all had a lot of free time.

In reality, something has changed recently in my life and it's something you usually don't associate to a programmer: yes, I committed the sin of building a family, with a wife and a daughterðŸ‘ª

So yes, I was itching my hands thinking of all the side projects I could complete, books I could learn, online meetups I could organize; in reality, I already have a fantastic job that takes 8-9 hours of my day and after that I have to disconnect from the job to reconnect with the family.

My wife is obviously caring for my daughter all day long and when I end my workday she is like "now it's your turn!" and disappears.

So, time for my personal projects is very limited and I'm trying to use it wisely. 

I'm using these days to answer cover some holes in my preparation, so for example **I'm studying C again**. At the time I studied C in university, I did not understand pointers very well. Now they feel like a natural concept, but back at the time it was my first meeting with a real programming language and it was too much for young Michele. 

The plan, however, is to try to understand some basics of how operating systems arae made. I was also reading a book about operating systems and when it started speaking about assembly and C I felt the urge to get those concepts back in my mind again.

Here are some of the questions I left unanswered: 

* Are C programs always compiled to one big application? 
* If not, How is it possible to compile a file into a library and use the library as an external resource in a C program? Is this something common in the Unix world?
* How are strings handled ? 
* Is everything global, even the functions declared in external files? What are the best practices to avoid name clashes? 
* What's the malloc/calloc/*alloc fuss? 

I know what you think, "_duuude these are very basic questions_" and really they are, but I was in some kind of learn-and-forget state during university and also it was my very first exam, it didn't go well: for example, once the vote was registered, I asked the teacher to redo the exam in order to "upgrade" my vote. He looked at me very calmly and said: "this is not how university works..." 

To conclude, if you have answers to the above questions, feel free to answer in the comments. If you're interested in detailed answers, I'll try to write some articles on C on my blog. I'm reading the K&D book, hopefully I should find all my answers there ;)
