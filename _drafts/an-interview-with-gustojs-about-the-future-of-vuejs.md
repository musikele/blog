### If you had a list of few core things that define Vue compared to other frameworks, what would you choose?  

Two main reasons wich made more sense for me: _The ease of use_, expecially for people that are designers or backend devs, but not true frontenders. VueJS is easier to learn because the amount of technology to master is smaller; with React you need a very good background in Javascript, and Angular provides the best experience with Typescript; if you don't use it, you will have troubles.  

Then, VueJS is also _flexible_. Officially we use the term _Progressive_. You don't have to adopt the whole ecosystem of VueJS; you can only plug the Vue object and it will work, also for small pieces of interactivity. Vue became popular with version 2, and I noticed that half of developers only wanted a way to replace jquery with something more modern, or even use VueJS together with JQuery. Only around 2018 those people started adopting VueJS with the whole pack. 

For these two groups VueJS is a viable alternative; but if your company is already using Angular or React, there is no big incentive or gain in the switch to VueJS. If your company has a lot of projects, and you can experiment, chosing VueJS can be a safe choice for a small project; the knowledge of VueJS can help you becoming a better React or Angular developer, and the inverse still apply, too. 

### Next question is about Open Source and money. There's a lot of people writing code for others; do they earn enough to live, or do they work for glory and hope that some company will hire them? 

For my experience, **the easiest way to find a job in development is though connections**. When you have lots of connections somebody can recommend you to some company. Open source gives you such opportunity: when you contribute to OS libraries you get to know other developers and get a lot of consulting opportunities. There's also opportunity to create learning material, like courses, or books - several core team members have written books published by important publishers. Some of them will also help learning platforms like EggHead, Vue Mastery, etc. 

Professional workshops are another source of income. Teaching is fun, but advanced topics are not for everybody and offering such courses are a good way to earn money. 

Platforms such as Patreon ad OpenCollective help funding projects. Patreon is directed to people and allows people to pay a small amount of money every month to somebody as a way to help him doing his job, or to thank for his work. Money from Patreon help Evan You to drop his other commitments and fully focus only on this framework. 

OpenCollective allows funding to a project; but if you get the money through OpenCollective, you must provide a record of expenses. One of the activities finenced by OpenCollective was VueSummit last year in Poland, a gathering of VueJS core developers spending a week together, working on new features of VueJS, or to other libraries, newsletters, documentation, vue cli, vue devtools, and was a good way to actually get to know each other: if the team is globally distributed it's very difficult to discuss freely, brainstorm and validate ideas. 

### How is a big project coordinated like Vue? 

Let's clear one big misunderstanding that many people have, commonly raised by Js developers, that VueJS is a one man person and only Evan You works on it: Core team member organization was created in 2015 when Evan realized that he alone cannot handle everything in the ecosystem for
