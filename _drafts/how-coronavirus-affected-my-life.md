I bet none of you believed to live the months we have just lived. I expected to see an earthquake, an eruption by the Vesuvius, a nuclear war, but for sure not a pandemy. 

Now that we're approaching summer, infections seem to decrease and the quarantine seems to be a thing of the past. To be clear, I am safe, all my family and my collleagues are safe, so we didn't have any health trouble during this period. 

But I cannot lie about the psycological effects of the quarantine. I feel it, in the way I have lived my family life, my work life, and my public life. 

My family life was one of the most affected. My wife temporary stopped working so she had to take care of my daughter, that is 3 years old, and has stopped going to pre-school. If schools do not open in september, we're fucked. My wife loved her work and she's done a lot to continue it even during quarantine and with a kid jumping on the sofa. So, when I finished my day job, it was my turn to take care of a baby that has been closed into four walls all day long - with the result that she's full of energy while I am exhausted. 

Regarding my work life, I am lucky my job wasn't cut. Of course, working in IT means we can work from everywhere, and luckily I am also a remote worker since 4 years so I experienced a little impact. Other programmers and more broadly workers were not so lucky. Anyway, I must admit that during some days I was in panic. The web was full of coronavirus news, and discussions were all about infections, laws, government, actions, in a way that it was really hard to concentrate and do my business. I am glad the worse has passed. 

The most important change in this area is that I am no longer working from a coworking space. I had to suspend my subscription 

The public life is the one I am regretting most. I loved to go out, visiting friends
