I've just completed the reading of a book calld **The Phoenix Project - a Novel about IT, DevOps, and helping your business win.**

Well, the book in question is about the story of Bill, a guy who was managing a team about legacy systems, and all of a sudden has found himself being nominated Vice President of IT Operations, since the two previous candidates have been probably fired, or who knows what. 

During the first day of this new role, infrastructure broke and a critical payroll system started returning all zeros.

It's funny how Bill discovers that there's no version control, nobody knows what happened, what everyone is working on, etc - it's like waking up in the middle of a ocean, and you can only navigate by sight. 

During the whole book we'll meet several roles, like Wes and Patty (two managers who work in Operations), Brent (an IT Engineer that seems to be the only one to know what's going on in every single moment), Steve (the CEO) and Erik (the guru). 

The book, expecially in the first part, is fantastic. You'll see that, no matter what they do, things continue to randomly break :) 

If you, like me, started working in IT during 2010, you probably remember the pain of releasing some software in production. The root cause is that there's a profund mismatch in skills from people who work in IT operation (those who are specialized in configuring _machines_) and those who work in development.
