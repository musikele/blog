        <section>
            <p>Some time ago a friend of mine called and said: “<em>Hey! I just coded the app I was thinking about three years ago</em>, <strong>would you want to join me</strong>?”</p>

<p>The incredible thing about this is that <strong>my friend is a law student</strong>. He had <strong>no idea about programming</strong>, so he learned everything by himself.</p>

<p><strong>Three years before, he asked me to code his dream</strong> - an e-commerce idea to help websites to get more clients &amp; revenue. I had just graduated, and <strong>I had the feeling that I could not program the amazing things that I saw around me.</strong> Everybody was doing great things, and <strong>all I knew about Computer Science was a bunch of (very important) theorems</strong> about what you can and what you can’t do with a computer.</p>

<p>So, <strong>I had to refuse the offer</strong> - starting a startup and having the feeling of not knowing how to work was my biggest fear..</p>

<p>Then I got a regular job as a computer programmer, starting to code in <em>Java</em> and its related technologies (Hibernate, Maven, GWT, than AngularJS).</p>

<p>After three years I have much more control and power on my capacities, so I feel like <strong>everything is feasible</strong> (<em>the opposite of three years before</em>!).</p>

<p>Returning to my friend, I was very surprised that he could code his idea, and even if the code that I saw was not perfect (it was coded in <strong>PHP</strong> but using a framework called <strong>Symfony</strong>), it was CODE that worked someway.</p>

<p>When he asked me to join him and help I had some concerns:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I am a <em>Java</em> programmer. In the last 3 years of my life, plus the years of university, I have studied Java as my primary programming language. I am using it every day. <strong>In PHP I have very little experience</strong>, based no what it was 5-6 years ago (a big amount of functions with no namespaces; queries, logic &amp; controllers where all together, everywhere. A big mess.).</li>
  <li>I have <strong>little to no time to dedicate to the project</strong>. since I have my job that is 9 to 18, from monday to friday, I have only the weekend to work on such things. And I usually have to care about my family, my house and my life. So … how to find the right amount of time?</li>
  <li><strong>I wanted to work to a side projects</strong> to improve my CV and to learn new things. <strong>Unfortunately I was unattracted by PHP</strong> and its technology stack.</li>
</ol>

<p>I managed to resolve the second problem: since I have to travel 45 minutes to go to work, I would work in the bus. It’s about 1,5 hrs of work everyday.</p>

<p>But I found myself having to study symfony for everything I wanted to do. the shift from Java to Php is not so great but annoying; syntax glitches like <span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline">$object.method()</span>  and <span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline">$object-&gt;method()</span>  (just to say the first!) have made to loose many hours in debug time. (both the expressions are legal in php so you don’t get errors!)</p>

<p>I’ve spent many hours studying Symfony documentation without studying enough PHP (newest) syntax.</p>

<p>Finally, I managed to do some small bugfixes but still could not make any substantial modification to the codebase.</p>

<h3 id="so-whats-going-on">So what’s going on?</h3>

<p>After many months I had another personal problem so I had less time to dedicate to this project. At the end I had to inform my partner that I could not help him anymore, at least for now.</p>

<p>This was not an easy decision for me but then I understood that I was asking more from myself, more than I could handle.</p>

<p>Lessons learned:</p>

<p>First, <strong>if you want to _startup _you should code in a language that you feel comfortable</strong>. My language is Java (not because it’s the best, but because I already know how to do everything!) and I have never thought to learn PHP. I have experimented  in Node, Ruby, Python… but not PHP. this language was not a priority for me and day after day I ended up hating it.</p>

<p>Second, <strong>if you don’t have time to do things, and you also have to learn before you do, you are going to hit your head against a hard wall. </strong>I say this because I think of myself as an average (==&gt; good!) programmer, and I believe that I can learn everything (==&gt; I’m a <a href="http://michelenasti.com/2015/02/quando-assumere-generalisti-vs-specialisti/">generalist</a>) <em>given the right amount of time</em>. And I don’t have time. So … It was hard to say, but I cannot work to side projects that demand high availability.</p>

<p>This was harder to accept for me than for my friend.</p>

<p>I really want that he finds a good programmer, skilled in PHP, that can help him growing fast to achieve his MVP. About me, I have still to find my way.</p>

                        <p>Ogni browser moderno dispone di avanzatissimi strumenti di sviluppo, Firefox è stato il primo con Firebug (ora integra un suo strumento interno) mentre Chrome ha dettato lo standard con Chrome Developer Tools. A seguire tutti i browser che volevano definirsi moderni hanno dovuto creare delle conosole di sviluppo “serie”, e supportare tutta una serie di costrutti Javascript per facilitare lo sviluppo e il debugging di queste applicazioni.</p>
